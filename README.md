# Auto Dino

Winning 2017 BYU ACM hackathon submission. We made a computer vision based bot that "solved" the chrome dino "no wifi" game. 

We took screenshots of the browser at 60FPS and processed them to view objects "cacti and birds" We then used some fairly simple heuristics to determine when to jump. 

Because our bot had super human reaction time it could play forever. We got high scores on all the websites we used it on. 

If you want to see it in action, check out the video we made https://andrewnc.github.io/projects/projects.html#auto-dino
